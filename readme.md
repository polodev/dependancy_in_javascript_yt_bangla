# Dependency in javascript   

Suppose you have 2 javascript file in your project. Before including those javascript file in your html file you have to check, the file you are going to add in your html, whether it depends on some other js file or html content. Before include any javascript file you have to include dependent javascript or dependent html content.        

Lot of js plugin depend on jquery. So In order to use those js plugin we have to include jquery first in our project  then plugin file      

eg: Bootstrap javascript file depend on jquery library and popper.js library. So we have to include jquery and popper.js before including bootstrap js file.
